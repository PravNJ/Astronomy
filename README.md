This is a hello world that I'm going through in order to familiarise myself with lightkurve and its tools. It's based on the following introdcutory workshop https://colab.research.google.com/github/christinahedges/KepSciConWorkshop/blob/master/Workshop.ipynb#scrollTo=4S0f2DCisPDw

Once I've gone through this workshop, my goal will be to go through the lighturve tutorials here http://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/ These tutorials are more in depth and hopefully a lot more technical and will allow me to level up.

These notebooks will be a combination of both tutorials and mostly a play-around for my own benefit.
